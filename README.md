## BitLive

This sample app was created when I received a test challenge to complete. My focus was on details and to avoid reinventing the wheel unless neccessary. I took advantage of 3 mainstream libraries to complete the task and focused my attention to the design and details such as unit/UI testing, color theme, animation for visual appeal and creating a catchy icon.

PS I was not selected to proceed further based on this. Request for additional feedback went unanswered so I'm unable to say why. Note: This repo has evolved since my submission

## Challenge

Thanks for applying at NUMBER26! To get to know your development process a little better, we would like to start things off with a small code challenge. Please read the task below and submit your final solution to us complete with source code and documentation.

You may use any set of technologies you see fit, so long as it completes the desired task appropriately, we don’t want to limit your use of libraries or frameworks, but please remember that it’s your code we want to see!

The Task

Create an iPhone app that will fetch the current exchange rate of Bitcoin/EUR (suggested resources will be provided below, however you may decide to use another) and display the data in a graph of your choosing.

The application must:

Fetch the historical data for the last 4 weeks up to today (daily data, 1 value per day)
Feed the 28 values into a graph
Continuously update the current price for today
Cache the data to show a graph "last fetched rates" upon app start while fetching new values
Extra mile: Long pressing on a particular day on the graph should flash its value. Also long pressing and dragging to other values should be possible
Please develop the application in a way that demonstrates your knowledge of clean, testable code.
